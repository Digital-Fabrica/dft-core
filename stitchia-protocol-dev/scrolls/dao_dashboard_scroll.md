# ðŸ§¬ DAO Dashboard

This scroll defines the DAO Dashboard framing used for governance visibility.

## Governance (Spiral Roles)
- Roles: Anchor, Architect, Steward, Initiator
- Metric: Spiral Members (example: 89)
- Display: Donut showing distribution by role

## Treasury
- Total ETH: sum of Staking + Protocol
- Buckets: Staking, Protocol (example values for mock)

## Proposals
- Status: Active, In Progress, Completed
- Cards: show title and status with age

## Wallet Integration
- Connect Wallet for role-aware UX and proposal creation

## Ethics
Display avoids implying financial returns. Governance metrics emphasize participation and stewardship.
